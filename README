Typetools fork of the JDK
=========================

This fork of the JDK contains type annotations for pluggable type-checking.

This fork is not up to date with respect to `openjdk/jdk` (the current OpenJDK version).
This fork contains all commits through the release of JDK 11:
https://github.com/typetools/jdk/commit/8a780d3273fe6f38ca392d63e89e3e8e552ac767

This fork is an ancestor of JDK release forks such as jdk11u.  This fork
does not compile, because the commit of `openjdk/jdk` on which it is based
no longer compiles, due to changes to tools such as compilers.
Repositories such as jdk11u and jdk12u have been updated and do compile.

This fork's annotations are pulled into those repositories, in order to
build an annotated JDK.  We do not write annotations in (say) jdk11u,
because it has diverged so far from other repositories that merging it into
jdk12u would be more painful than merging jdk into both jdk11u and jdk12u.


Pull request merge conflicts
----------------------------

If a pull request is failing with a merge conflict in `jdk11u`, do the
following in a clone of the branch of `jdk` whose pull request is failing.

```
BRANCH=`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
URL=`git config --get remote.origin.url`
SLUG=${URL#*:}
ORG=${SLUG%/*}
JDK11DIR=../jdk11u-fork-$ORG-branch-$BRANCH
JDK11URL=`echo "$URL" | sed 's/jdk/jdk11u/'`
if [ -d $JDK11DIR ] ; then
  (cd $JDK11DIR && git pull)
else
  git clone $JDK11URL $JDK11DIR && (cd $JDK11DIR && git checkout -b $BRANCH)
fi
cd $JDK11DIR
git pull $URL $BRANCH
```

Manual step: merge conflicts

```
git push --set-upstream origin $BRANCH
```

Manual step: restart the pull request CI job.

After the pull request is merged to https://github.com/typetools/jdk,
follow the instructions at https://github.com/typetools/jdk11u to update
jdk11u, taking guidance from branch MYBRANCH of ORG/jdk11u to resolve conflicts.
Then, discard branch MYBRANCH of ORG/jdk11u.
